# Formula D

I love the game [Formula D][bgg]. I'd like to see if I can solve it,
just for fun.

At first, I am going to just have one lane per straight section. Corners will
have their three stats: shortest path length, longest path length, and number
of stops required.

The output at first will simply be the recommended gear. Lane positioning,
corner physics, and damage suffered will not yet be tracked.
